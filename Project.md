## CPIT 280: Project Plan
- A description of the problem that your team is trying to solve. 
- Name three related projects that attempt to solve the same problem.
  -  Discuss what problems and limitations exist in these related projects.
  - Describe how your project will address these limitations.


## In-class activities

- An example on something has a good usability (easy to use) but UX is bad (not fun to use.
- Think of something that is beautifully designed but hard to use.


Mapping
- Up and down buttons
- Scrollbar as you scroll you will see the effect (going to down) and the result (where you're at middle, bottom, top of the page)

Affordance.
Be aware!!
perceived (user interfaces) and real Affordance (physical objects) 


## Nilsen's Usability Heuristics
1. Visibility of system status- always keep users informed about what is going on, through providing appropriate feedback within reasonable time2. Match between system and the real world- speak the users' language, using words, phrases and concepts familiar to the user, rather than system- oriented terms3. Usercontrolandfreedom-providewaysofallowinguserstoeasilyescape from places they unexpectedly find themselves, by using clearly marked 'emergency exits'4. Consistency and standards- avoid making users wonder whether different words, situations, or actions mean the same thing5. Help users recognize, diagnose, and recover from errors- use plain lan- guage to describe the nature of the problem and suggest a way of solving it6. error prevention-where possible prevent errors occurring in the first place7. Recognition rather than recall- make objects, actions, and options visible8. Flexibility and efficiency of use- provide accelerators that are invisible to novice users, but allow more experienced users to carry out tasks more quickly9. Aesthetic and minimalist design- avoid using information that is irrelevant or rarely needed10. Help and documentation- provide information that can be easily searched and provides help in a set of concrete steps that can easily be followed

## Assignment 1
Read Don Norman's Design Principles. Norman introduces a number of design principles such as visibility, feedback, constraints, mapping, consistency, and affordances. For this assignment, pick an example of an object or a device that you use and give an example of two design principles manifested in it. Do not pick an example from the chapter or any other reference. 


## Assignment 2
Read Jakob Nielsen's Usability Heuristics. Nielsen discusses ten usability heuristics for interaction design. For this assignment, pick an example of an app that you use and give an example of three usability heuristics are well implemented or not considered in your app of choice. Do not pick an example from the chapter or any other reference. Please post a screenshot of the app if it's something your instructor may not be familiar with.


When taking these design principles into practice, they are called huristics.

Heuristics tend to be more prescriptive

When design principles are used in practice they are commonly referred to as heuristics.

I'm working on setting up the submission of assignments on Blackboard. This will be done shortly once I resolve the issue I've with accessing Blackboard. For now, let's use slack for posting and submitting the assignments.

The first assignment is:
